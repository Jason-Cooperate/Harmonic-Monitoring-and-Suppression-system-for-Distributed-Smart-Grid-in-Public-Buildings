# Harmonic Monitoring and Suppression System for Distributed Smart Grid in Public Buildings

------

This project mainly implements SDAFS(Spatial Distributed Active Filter System) in large public buildings, and provides corresponding solutions considering  smart grid (SG) and smart buildings for better Human-computer interaction and IoT transmission stability.The projects completed by our team are as follows:

## Architectural modeling
  We modeled a large public building in Shanghai to provide a simulation basis for EnergyPlus. Modeled as follows:
